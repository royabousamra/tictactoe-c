# Tic Tac Toe using C
## Tic Tac Toe (Base)
Basic 3x3 tic tac toe game implemented on C.

## Tic Tac Toe (4x4)
Similar to the classic tic tac toe game but with a 4 by 4 grid. 

## Tic Tac Toe (3D)
Implements 3 different boards next to each other. There aren't definite rules on how a 3x3x3 tic tac toe game works, so the first box of board 1 and the middle box of board 2 and the last box of board 3 (and vice versa) will make a 3D diagonal line and thus the game will be won.

# MATLAB Project
All different versions of Tic Tac Toe read from and write to a scoreboard. The MATLAB project includes 3 functions:  
1. winsplot (that plots the number of wins for all players in a pie chart).  
2. lossesplot (similar to winsplot).  
3. stats (which takes the first and last name of a player and plots his/her grading layout in a bar graph).
